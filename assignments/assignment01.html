    IntroHCI assignment template
    ------------------
    To create a new assignment:
    1) Write all the HTML as you normally would underneath the #assignment-description div.
    2) Anything that you want to appear in the navbar on the left needs to be enclosed
        in a <div id="unique-id" class="sidenav-anchor">. On page load, hci.js will look up
        anything enclosed in .sidenav-anchor, find the first header (h1-h6) inside it, and add
        it to the navigation pane on the left. Make sure it has a unique div id so that there is something
        to anchor the hyperlink to.
    3) I recommend going with Bootstrap's recommendation and putting any <table class="table"> elements enclosed in a
        <div class="table-responsive">.

                    Designer: "Does it have to be a light bulb?"</i></p>

                <div id="brief" class="sidenav-anchor">
                    <h2>Brief</h2>
                    <p>Think about some of the designs that you consider to be great innovations. Quite likely, they came about because the design team was able to see a new problem or opportunity, or reframe things in a new way. As the light bulb joke illustrates, an important strategy of successful designers is to reframe things so that... we can see things in a new light. This first week's exercise is intended to work your perception and reframing "muscles". How creative can you be? (Later exercises will work different "muscles".)</p>
                    <p>Any questions about this assignment should be posed to the forums and will be answered promptly by the staff. </p>
                    <p>For this first project, <b>your mission is to redesign the experience of waiting in line</b>.</p>
                    <p>An important part of the designer's role is to come up with a point of view. For example, your point of view might be that standing in line is intrinsic, but being bored is not.</p>
                    <p>What can we do with our time that is more productive, more interesting, or more entertaining than just wait? Maybe it's reading the news, playing a game, or preempt the parents by giving them a surprise call? Alternatively, your point of view might be to eliminate the line by preordering, or hire people to act as placeholders in the line? Or maybe this is precious time for us to do nothing? A few minutes to space out, or quickly center ourselves. No matter what you come up with, it should be something that <b>improves the experience of standing in line</b>. For one jumping off point, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/19/opinion/sunday/why-waiting-in-line-is-torture.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=1&amp;">here's a few thoughts from the New York Times</a>.</p>
                    <p>This assignment will introduce iterative design so that during the main course project, the steps of the design process will be more familiar. For further explanations about the design process, have a look at the <b>d.school Bootcamp Bootleg</b> <a href="http://dschool.stanford.edu/use-our-methods/">here</a>.</p>

                <div id="observation" class="sidenav-anchor">
                    <h4>Observation, interviews</h4>
                    <p>Observing people helps designers learn more about their needs, goals, desires, abilities, values, and situation. In this assignment, we bootstrapped this process for you by observing and interviewing people about standing in line. You can find the video <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G54ByXSS0c">here</a>. Go through the video. If you have the opportunity, you are encouraged to observe and interview line-waiters by yourself.</p>

                <div id="brainstorming" class="sidenav-anchor">
                    <h4>Brainstorming</h4>
                    <p>Use insights from it as background material, and brainstorm ideas for how you would redesign the waiting in line experience. <b>Go for volume</b> when you brainstorm, you should come up with <b>at least 20 different ideas</b>. Ask a couple of people to get together and brainstorm with you, you will find that it's easier to find inspiration when you work with other people.</p>
                </div>

                <div id="narrowing" class="sidenav-anchor">                
                    <h4>Narrowing, synthesizing</h4>
                    <p>Select your two favorite ideas and give a 1-sentence explanation of why you chose each. Choosing these two prototypes does not mean that you will have to work on them for the rest of the quarter. We would like you to get a good idea of how to use these skills and determine problems before choosing your final project idea.</p>
                </div>

                <div id="prototyping" class="sidenav-anchor">
                    <h4>Prototyping</h4>
                    <p>Take these two ideas and rapidly prototype them. Really rapidly. No computers. <b>Go for very, very simple.</b> For instance, if your idea involves a mobile phone, use 3 x 5 index cards to represent the screen, and a sharpie. Anything that won't fit into that is too detailed. If your idea is more conceptual, rapidly prototype the experience however you see fit. Use any props you think will effectively convey the look and feel of the user experience, but remember to keep it simple. As a rule of thumb, each prototype should take about a half-hour to produce.</p>
                    <p>Take pictures of your prototypes.</p>
                </div>

                <div id="testing" class="sidenav-anchor">
                    <h4>Testing</h4>
                    <p>Now you are ready for feedback. Pick one of your prototypes and find people (people really waiting in line) to try it out. Go to the place you intend your design to be used, people who will use your prototype as if it was a real application. Explain that you'd like their help, and that it'll take 5-10 minutes of their time. If the activity is quick, we recommend trying it on at least 5 people. If it takes some time, at least 3 users should be fine.</p>
                    <p>Given that your prototype is made of pulp, markers, and imagination, you'll need to be an active operator. For example, if a user "clicks" a button, you simulate what would happen by changing screens (new index card). Do not tell the user what to do. Prototypes are a probe; a way to get feedback and learn how to improve your design. Success is not blithely saying "people really liked it" but rather "I learned all of these cool things that will make the design better". Iterative design is about "failing" early and often, in order to rapidly arrive at a great design.</p>
                    <p>Take notes and pictures of what users do and say. Pay attention to when people get confused or if they offer feedback on what they liked or didn't like.  Use your notes to help you reflect on the feedback you received; distill a list of major insights that could inform a future revision. These insights should require some reflection on your part; it is not just taking what users say point blank.</p>

                      <li>For each of the two prototypes, one sentence explaining why you chose it.</li>
                      <li>Photos of your prototypes.</li>
                      <li>Photos of user testing (make sure that at least one photograph shows the setting of the test so we can see it's an authentic setting).</li>
                      <li>List of insights from user testing.</li>
