    IntroHCI assignment template
    ------------------
    To create a new assignment:
    1) Write all the HTML as you normally would underneath the #assignment-description div.
    2) Anything that you want to appear in the navbar on the left needs to be enclosed
        in a <div id="unique-id" class="sidenav-anchor">. On page load, hci.js will look up
        anything enclosed in .sidenav-anchor, find the first header (h1-h6) inside it, and add
        it to the navigation pane on the left. Make sure it has a unique div id so that there is something
        to anchor the hyperlink to.
    3) I recommend going with Bootstrap's recommendation and putting any <table class="table"> elements enclosed in a
        <div class="table-responsive">.

                    <h2>Brief</h2>
                    <p>The goal of this assignment is to test your prototype with people and learn from that experience. To get the kinks out of your application, first test it with a couple of people.</p>
                </div>

                <div id="usertests" class="sidenav-anchor">
                    <h4>Watch people use your prototype</h4>
                    <p>Watch <strong>at least two different people</strong> use your interactive prototype. These do not have to be planned out ahead of time, but try to get people who are somewhat similar to the real people who will be using your application.</p>
                    <p>Just like when you conducted the Heuristic Evaluations, each team member will have its own role during testing. One person will be the facilitator, one will be in charge of taking notes/photos/video/etc. Any team member who is not currently in one of those two roles should observe and take notes. This time your user will not be writing down the problems they find for you. It's your job to learn what the people testing your prototype are thinking; the feedback they provide you will be invaluable for your next iteration. <strong>Your goal is to find ways to improve your interface.</strong> Look for breakdowns and pain points in your interface and try to understand what the problems are and how you might fix them.<strong> If possible, try modifying or updating your prototype before continuing to the next person.</strong></p>
                    <p>As much as possible, keep the situation consistent between the different people who test your prototype: use the same script, follow the same protocol, answer questions in the same way. We are not asking you to be do an extremely formal study but any study will require a little bit of planning before hand. Basically don't spend too much time planning this study, but you should have an idea of what you are going to ask people to do and not vary that between users. No formal write up of your plan for the study is required. Submit any materials you used during the study. The bare minimum is a consent form for people who tested your prototype to sign. Here is a <a href="http://www.indiana.edu/~usable/templates/Participant_consent_form.htm">consent form</a> that you can modify to use for your study. Immediately after each test, do a quick debrief with your team and write down any reactions or thoughts that came up. You will most likely forget them, so it's important to write them down right after the test.</p>
                    <p><strong>Submit at least two photos (with captions) of people testing your prototype.</strong> As with the needfinding assignment, these photos and captions should show breakdowns and design opportunities.</p>
                </div>

                <div id="results" class="sidenav-anchor">
                    <h4>Results</h4>
                    <p>After testing, take some time with your team to reflect on your findings. Go through all the notes and other recordings. Try to be objective; don't write problems off. Discuss as a team and try and define some general patterns in people's behavior.  When you identify some interesting points, talk deeply about them - ask each other questions, recreate the different tests, analyze the decisions people made, other paths they could have taken, and so on. Let your insights guide redesigns for your next prototype iteration. <strong>The end product of your discussion should be a list of changes that you will implement. Make this list detailed and understandable to people outside of your team.</strong> Of all the bugs that you have identified, fix the bugs that are either small and easy to fix or too severe to ignore. Make sure that you do this before moving on to the next step of this assignment.</p>

                <div id="altredesign" class="sidenav-anchor">
                    <h4>Create an alternative redesign</h4>
                    <p>Select <strong>one</strong> interface element of your prototype and redesign that part. You will then implement the redesign of this component, so keep this in mind when considering the scale and difficulty of your redesign. This is <strong>not</strong> a huge redesign of your prototype. Select something small and manageable in scope. Designers often go through many many different versions of prototypes before their final design, so try to get familiar with the process (given our time constraints for the course).</p>
                    <p>Next week, you will explore the web as another tool for gathering user feedback about your application by launching an A/B test online. Refer to the lecture notes regarding controlled web experiments (e.g. A/B testing, control groups, etc.). Think about what you are asking, and how to prepare a study to answer it. <strong>Try to think of A/B tests that will give you information that this week's user testing didn't (or couldn't).</strong> Next week, when you launch your A/B test online, the alternative redesign you implemented this week will be the 'B' of your A/B test. You will need to have access to both versions of this component to run your online tests - don't write over your old code!</p>

                        <li>A list of changes you will implement in your next iteration (for each change, include a brief explanation for why you selected it and don't forget to describe it with enough detail that someone outside of your team can understand it).</li>
                        <li>The URL of the implemented alternative redesign of one interface element. In 2 to 3 sentences, describe the online test you will run for the next assignment.</li>
