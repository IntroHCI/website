    IntroHCI assignment template
    ------------------
    To create a new assignment:
    1) Write all the HTML as you normally would underneath the #assignment-description div.
    2) Anything that you want to appear in the navbar on the left needs to be enclosed
        in a <div id="unique-id" class="sidenav-anchor">. On page load, hci.js will look up
        anything enclosed in .sidenav-anchor, find the first header (h1-h6) inside it, and add
        it to the navigation pane on the left. Make sure it has a unique div id so that there is something
        to anchor the hyperlink to.
    3) I recommend going with Bootstrap's recommendation and putting any <table class="table"> elements enclosed in a
        <div class="table-responsive">.

                    <h4>Run In-Person User Tests</h4>
                    <p>Run user tests on your interactive prototype with <strong>at least two different people</strong>. These do not have to be planned out ahead of time, but try to get testers who are somewhat similar to the real users of your application. </p>
                    <p>Just like when you conducted the Heuristic Evaluations, each team member will have its own role during testing. One person will be the facilitator, one will be in charge of taking notes/photos/video/etc. Any team member who is not currently in one of those two roles should observe and take notes. This time your user will not be writing down the problems they find for you. It's your job to learn what your users are thinking, the feedback they provide you will be invaluable for your next iteration. <strong>Your high-level goal is to find ways to improve your interface.</strong> Look for breakdowns and pain points in your interface and try to understand what the problems are and how you might fix them.<strong> If possible, try modifying or updating your prototype before continuing to the next user.</strong></p>
                    <p>As much as possible, keep things consistent between your user tests: use the same script, follow the same protocol, answer questions in the same way. We are not asking you to be do an extremely formal user study but any user study will require a little bit of planning before hand. Basically don't spend too much time planning this user study, but as with any user study, you should have an idea of what you are going to ask your users to do and not vary that between users.No formal write up of your plan for the user study is required. It's always a good idea to submit any materials you use during the user study and in this case, we would like to see evidence of the fact that you have used a consent form. The deliverables for this portion of the assignment is to show evidence of a little planning, the bare minimum being a consent form for your users to sign. Immediately after each test, do a quick debrief with your team and write down any reactions or thoughts that came up. You will most likely forget them, so it's important to write them down right after the user test. Don't worry so much about the exact process of testing users, the point of this user test is to find all the obvious bugs with your app. Here is a <a href="http://www.indiana.edu/~usable/templates/Participant_consent_form.htm">consent form</a> that you can modify to use for your study.</p>
                    <p><strong>We would like you to submit at least two photos (with captions) of your user testing.</strong> As with the needfinding assignment, these photos and captions should show breakdowns and design opportunities. We won't be grading you directly on these photos and captions, but we will be grading you on how well you executed your user testing, and so having clear photos / captions will definitely help.</p>
                </div>

                <div id="results" class="sidenav-anchor">
                    <h4>Results</h4>
                    <p>After testing, take some time with your team to reflect on your findings. Go through all the notes and other recordings. Try to be objective, don't write problems off. Discuss as a team and try and define some general patterns in user behavior.  When you identify some interesting points, talk deeply about them - ask each other questions, recreate the different user tests, analyze user decisions, other paths they could have taken, and so on. Let your insights guide redesigns for your next prototype iteration. <strong>The end product of your discussion should be a list of changes that you will implement. Make this list detailed and understandable to people outside of your team.</strong> Of all the bugs that you have identified, fix the bugs that are either small and easy to fix or too severe to ignore. Make sure that you do this before moving on to the next step of this assignment.</p>

                <div id="altredesign" class="sidenav-anchor">                
                    <h4>Alternative Redesign</h4>
                    <p>Select <strong>one</strong> component of your prototype and come up with a redesign for that part. You will be making an implementation of your redesign, keep this in mind when considering the scale and difficulty of your redesign. Mock up a couple of screens and elements for your redesign. &nbsp;This is like a mini paper prototype that you can use to test with a user.</p>
                    <p>This is <strong>not</strong> a huge redesign of your prototype. &nbsp;Select something small and manageable in scope. &nbsp;Designers often go through many many different versions of prototypes before their final design, so try to get familiar with the process (given our time constraints for the course). <strong>Previously, we used the paper prototype to get quick user feedback. This year, the purpose of the paper prototype is to help you think through your design without a huge investment of time.</strong> Code is a commitment to a particular design and one of the key ideas in this class is the benefits of rapid prototyping. Think of the paper prototype like the specification for an operating system or the design doc for a networking project. You wouldn't just sit down and code those larger systems up, you would first go through the process of thinking your design through. It's a good practice to think through a design before going to any implementation.</p>
                </div>

                <div id="alttesting" class="sidenav-anchor">
                    <h4>Implement Alternative for Testing</h4>
                    <p>As you create your plan for your online tests in the next step, you'll quickly come to realize that you need an alternative -- a 'B' so to speak, for your 'A/B' testing. Since you'll need to launch your test before Thursday, work on your implementation of your alternative design.  It's up to you how you want to go about doing this - whether that's a separate branch on Git or using Optimizely. You will need to have access to both versions of your application to run your online tests - don't write over your old code! (Remember Optimizely gives you tools to make variations, but your variations may require more than simple dragging and dropping, in which case Optimizely also lets you redirect your users to a separate page, i.e. your separate code).</p>
                </div>

                <div id="plan" class="sidenav-anchor">
                    <h4>Plan Online User Tests</h4>
                    <p>We want you to explore the web as another tool for gathering user feedback  about your application. Refer to the lecture notes regarding controlled  web experiments (e.g. A/B testing, control groups, etc.). Think  about&nbsp;what you are asking, and how to prepare a study to answer it. We are going to be running A/B tests on your application, comparing your redesign to your original application. <strong>Try to think of A/B tests that will give you information that this week's user testing didn't (or couldn't).</strong> You will be <strong>required</strong> to turn in evidence of launching your test for this assignment.</p>
                    <p>We are going to be using <a href="http://optimizely.com">Optimizely</a> for running your A/B testing. Please sign up for a 30 day trial (you will need a credit card, but no money will be charged for 30 days). With your team, figure out exactly what you want to test and how you are set up that test in Optimizely. Write up both your idea for your test and your rationale behind it. Check the <a href="http://spark-public.s3.amazonaws.com/hci/lab_videos/Optimizely.mp4">video</a> for a tutorial on how to use Optimizely.</p> 
                    <p>Groups that are doing native apps should use <a href="https://testflightapp.com/">TestFlight</a> to test your apps. You are required to figure out how to run your tests in an analogous manner to Optimizely. There are open sourced libraries that allow you to do A/B testing easily.</p>
                    <p>You will be presenting the results of your online test in the next assignment. Since this is two weeks away, you will have plenty of time to run tests, analyze the results, and update your app appropriately. Your test results will be a key and critical part of your final presentation.</p>
                    <p>Write up both your idea for your test and your rationale behind it. Potential avenues of exploration include changes in color, content and interface placement, and/or interaction method. However, make sure that before you launch your test you know exactly what you want to have answered (but not the answer), and that the results in whatever form will be useful towards your design. Recall the earlier lectures about how to properly formulate questions that aren't leading your audience to choose one interface or another. Just changing color won't necessarily help shape your final product in a meaningful way, but subtle things like "Sign up now" as opposed to "Tap here to sign up" can be surprisingly insightful.</p>
                    <p><strong>Optimizely does not recruit users for you.</strong> You will have to recruit your own users.</p><p>
                    </p><p>Since you will be doing a  statistical analysis of the data you receive, you'll want <strong>at least 20 users</strong> for any online test you run. Thus, you'll want to have your test run for <strong>at least one week after the launch by this Thursday</strong>. Other than that, how you schedule your online testing analysis around your implementation plan is up to you. Do what's best for your app and your group. Just remember that you'll be presenting your online testing results on the same day as your final app. We highly encourage running more than one test, but we don't require it.</p>
                    <p>If you have any questions about online testing, please post them to the forum.</p>

There are clearly aspects of the test that have not been thought through and it is evident that the group did not spend enough time completing this part of the assignment.</td>
