    IntroHCI assignment template
    ------------------
    To create a new assignment:
    1) Write all the HTML as you normally would underneath the #assignment-description div.
    2) Anything that you want to appear in the navbar on the left needs to be enclosed
        in a <div id="unique-id" class="sidenav-anchor">. On page load, hci.js will look up
        anything enclosed in .sidenav-anchor, find the first header (h1-h6) inside it, and add
        it to the navigation pane on the left. Make sure it has a unique div id so that there is something
        to anchor the hyperlink to.
    3) I recommend going with Bootstrap's recommendation and putting any <table class="table"> elements enclosed in a
        <div class="table-responsive">.

                    <h2>Assignment</h2>
                    <p>This week is all about - that's right - functionality. You should be spending your time fleshing out your interactive prototype. Focus on getting the flow of your interaction working. Don't worry about making it look pretty yet. Don't stall or get too caught up in the look and feel of things. Fonts, colors, and pixel-perfect layout can come later. This week, you'll need to make good progress this week on the interaction design. Use the JSON and handlebars techniques you learned in lab (or equivalent technology) to populate the data for your application and deliver rich interactivity.</p>
                    <p>Follow the development plan you created last week, and update it as you go. Mark tasks that have been completed and add new ones if you need to. Make sure that your next week is planned out with goals and who is responsible for each task. (If you'd like to give yourself the option of "late days", set an early deadline so your schedule has some flexibility.)</p>

                        <li>The PDF of your development plan that you submitted last week.</li>
                        <li>The PDF of your updated development plan. (<i>We recommend making a Google spreadsheet and saving it as a pdf; this gives you a snapshot for comparison.</i>)</li>

                    <p>Note: since we may grade your assignment up to a few days after submission, per the honor code, we expect that the prototype URL show the state of your prototype at the time of submission. You will very likely be updating your prototype after submission, but please do so on another version.</p>
