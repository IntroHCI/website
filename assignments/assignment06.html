    IntroHCI assignment template
    ------------------
    To create a new assignment:
    1) Write all the HTML as you normally would underneath the #assignment-description div.
    2) Anything that you want to appear in the navbar on the left needs to be enclosed
        in a <div id="unique-id" class="sidenav-anchor">. On page load, hci.js will look up
        anything enclosed in .sidenav-anchor, find the first header (h1-h6) inside it, and add
        it to the navigation pane on the left. Make sure it has a unique div id so that there is something
        to anchor the hyperlink to.
    3) I recommend going with Bootstrap's recommendation and putting any <table class="table"> elements enclosed in a
        <div class="table-responsive">.

                    <p>Start by taking a look at the feedback you got last week from the Heuristic Evaluations of your prototypes. If you didn't get any feedback at all, either (a) go through the list of heuristics yourself and find any that are violated, or (b) ask a friend for help (we recommend (b): it is easy to overlook your own mistakes). Distill the HE results into a list of concrete changes you want to make to your prototype. Use what worked, and improve what didn't.</p>

By the end of this week your <b>prototypes should be fully interactive</b> and <b>ready to be tested</b>.By fully interactive, we mean that all interface elements should be created (and properly linked to each other if applicable) and a user should be able to navigate through your site to perform specific tasks. If you planned it out right and you have been doing your work, you should be in good shape. If not, it's time to step it up. <b>You will get much less out of user testing if you are still struggling with incomplete interactions and a half finished interface.</b></p>

                    <p>by Mike Davison, Community TA and UX Project Manager</p><p>‘Where to stop’ with a prototype can be hard to judge. Lets say you have a flight search application.</p><p>You will probably want to demonstrate the process of searching, selecting and booking ONE flight, and test that this works. When you present your search results screen, only one flight needs to work to prove your point; the others can be static. Just ensure you highlight that to the user, for example a speech bubble stating ‘book this flight’.</p><p>Always ask - is this useful? Do you learn any more from your flight search application if every flight ‘works’? We recently completed a UX design project for a banking software application. To populate every field with data on shares, live information on stock prices, current account balances, and making sure all transfer functions worked would have been incredibly time consuming, so we focussed on one share type, one payment time and importantly, one client type. It told us all we need to know - the rest is a variation on the same theme.</p><p>Remember, the point of a prototype is to demonstrate the ‘idea’ of an application, without the need to code the whole thing as it will stand when it’s finished. Just ensure the user can complete the task!</p></i>

It is hard to find any HE violations at all in the new prototype.</td></tr><tr><td>Interactive Prototype</td><td>0: No prototype or irrelevant prototype.</td><td>1: The prototype is not interactive, lacks many features, and has many bugs; the design does not work with the goal.

Why in a school? etc).</td><td>5: The evaluation plan is very clearly motivated or innovative in a way that will ensure rich and interesting data to address the design goals.</td></tr><tr><td>Development Goals</td><td>0: No goals met that were laid out on the development plan.</td><td>1: The student met a few of the goals laid out in the development plan.</td><td>2: The student met most, but not all, of the goals laid out in the development plan.</td><td>3: The student met all of the goals found in the development. </td></tr></tbody></table>
