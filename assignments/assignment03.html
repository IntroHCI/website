    IntroHCI assignment template
    ------------------
    To create a new assignment:
    1) Write all the HTML as you normally would underneath the #assignment-description div.
    2) Anything that you want to appear in the navbar on the left needs to be enclosed
        in a <div id="unique-id" class="sidenav-anchor">. On page load, hci.js will look up
        anything enclosed in .sidenav-anchor, find the first header (h1-h6) inside it, and add
        it to the navigation pane on the left. Make sure it has a unique div id so that there is something
        to anchor the hyperlink to.
    3) I recommend going with Bootstrap's recommendation and putting any <table class="table"> elements enclosed in a
        <div class="table-responsive">.

                    <h4>Point of View</h4>
                    <p><b>What's a point of view?</b> It's your take on a high-level design strategy, before actually designing a solution.</p>
                    <ul>
                    <p></p><li>For example, if you wanted to improve the check-out experience at the grocery store, your point of view might be: "waiting in line is intrinsic, but the boredom is not". This would lead to design solutions like showing news or playing games while waiting in line.</li><li>Alternatively your point of view might be "with a good scheduling interface, no one should have to wait in line." This might lead to better ways for employees to staff registers and consumers to pick them.</li>
                    <li>Or, you might have a totally different point of view: let's make grocery stores more like farmers' markets, where payment is distributed across the stands that have the food.</li></ul><p>All of these are valid points of view---they do suggest different possibilities and have different implications/entailments for what constitutes a good design. They do not restrict your thinking to one solution - they are general enough to give scope for multiple solutions.</p><p><b>What makes a good point of view?</b> It should clearly express the problem/opportunity. And it should make clear what a good solution would accomplish. Write yours down.</p><p>Remember that you will work on this project for the rest of the quarter. Thus, coming up with a good point of view that you can successfully tackle in the remaining weeks is crucial.</p>

                <div id="inspriationboard" class="sidenav-anchor">
                    <h4>Make an inspiration board</h4>
                    <p>Your next step is to find inspiration for the solutions you will be brainstorming. Inspiration can be existing applications, artifacts, products, services, or anything that relates to your concept. Here, web search is your friend (potentially useful sites include Google, Google Scholar, the ACM Digital Library, TechCrunch, Engadget...). Some things you find will be quite related, but it is important to interpret "related" broadly. The relationship could be very concrete or very abstract. It may be that a carrot-peeler or a measuring cup is your inspiration for an elegant and ergonomic software interface design. You may be inspired to improve upon an existing service or go in a totally different direction. Cast the net wide and find as much (i.e., diverse inspirations) as you can.</p><p><b>Your Inspiration Board:</b></p>
                    <p>a) Start your “inspiration board” by listing 5-10 words that relate to your design idea. These words can be anything -- from similar designs to feelings that the idea evokes.</p><p>b) Once you’ve listed your words, come up with at least five inspirations, and share them by providing links or images to the submission. For each inspiration, give a brief (1-2 sentences) and insightful explanation of why you chose it (What did you take away from it? What did you learn from it?... In other words, why did it inspire you?). Each of these inspirations should offer a different perspective to the design you are working on.</p><p><b>Benefits of Inspiration Boards:</b></p><p>1) Making an inspiration board helps you understand the existing landscape, sort of like a competitive analysis.
                    </p><p>2) Inspiration boards help inspire you to do things you wouldn’t have otherwise thought of.
                    </p><p><u>Good example:</u> If you were making a travel app, your words could be: relaxing, paradise, getaway, Europe, blue, etc. Then, some inspirations could be tripadvisor.com, souvenirs, twitter, Bank of America mobile banking app, and so on. You should not be submitting inspirations with tripadvisor.com, travelocity.com, expedia.com, as these websites all offer the same type of services and therefore, do not add anything “diverse” to the set.
                    While it’s true that Google has a clean minimal layout and the iPhone has a beautiful design, citing those as inspiration wouldn’t be very specific.
                    </p><p>Remember to be creative. Think big, but also stay focused and be specific with your inspirations.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <div id="storyboard" class="sidenav-anchor">
                    <h4>Storyboard</h4>
                    <p>Next, come up with two design ideas that address/engage your point of view. Illustrate each of these ideas with a storyboard.</p><p>A storyboard is a comic-strip-like set of drawings about what your interface does and how it is used to accomplish tasks in a real usage scenario. Feeling stumped about how to show your ideas visually? Check out "<a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=tUwqbo48lp4C">Understanding Comics</a>" by Scott McCloud and Amal Dar Aziz's excellent <a href="http://spark-public.s3.amazonaws.com/hci/assignment_ressources/assignment3_storyboard_notes.pdf">Guide to Storyboarding</a>. A good storyboard should clearly demonstrate who the user is, the usage situation, and the user's motivations for using the interface. It should show what the user can accomplish with your interface, but it needn't (and often shouldn't) show a specific user interface design.</p><p>Each storyboard should comprise 5-8 panels and fit on two 8.5" x 11" sheets of paper. Use a thick pen like a Sharpie---ballpoint pen or pencil is not acceptable. A thick pen is a good reminder to focus on the high-level and not sweat the details at this point. (Don't worry, in a few weeks you'll have plenty of time to sweat the details.)</p>
                </div>

                <div id="paperprototype" class="sidenav-anchor">
                    <h4>Paper Prototype</h4>
                    <p>Set out your storyboards. Take some time to discuss the different ideas you've had. Make sure you discuss the strengths and weaknesses of each design, and how well they achieve the goals set out by your point of view. And then, as a team, decide on one of these ideas to prototype. Buy-in and joint ownership are critical here. If the discussion takes a while, that's cool. (Disenfranchisement at this point is way bad, as it means you'll be up alone pulling late nights, while your teammate is sleeping, angry you didn't pick their idea.)</p>
                    <p>Working as a group, make two paper prototypes that implement the idea you've decided on. (Can you see we really value enumerating alternatives?) A paper prototype concretely shows all the elements of a user interface, except that it's implemented with pen on paper, as opposed to pixels and code. Paper prototypes must be hand-drawn. No computers and printers are allowed. Again, it helps focus on the concepts, and saves you from wasting hours twiddling pixels. Years after taking this course, students often come back and tell us that paper prototyping was their favorite part of the class because of its effectiveness for rapid ideation.</p>
                    <p>The prototypes should vary in interface, but offer the same basic functionality. For example, if you were designing a mobile transit application, your two prototypes could display the bus times in two very different ways. The prototypes should be complete enough to "run" a new user through each task. When you're done, everyone on your team should sign the prototypes. (Note: the story here is very linear, but your process doesn't have to be. You can start making a paper prototype, then change your mind. And your prototype doesn't have to exactly align with your storyboard. But don't try to split up the work just to get the assignment done, where one person makes the storyboard while the other makes the prototype. That's not very effective.) Your prototype interface should enable people to navigate, recover from errors, and change their mind.</p>

                    <p>by Mike Davison, Community TA and UX Project Manager</p><p>Agencies use storyboards to convey to clients potential solutions to a given problem....problems discovered during needfinding. Doing it this way allows you to tell a story and explain how a user will interact with your design, without the need to draw a single pixel or code a single line. Storyboards are generally used during the discovery phase of a project, or during pitching activities when we are trying to dazzle a client with our creative thinking!</p></i>
