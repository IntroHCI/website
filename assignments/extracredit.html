    IntroHCI assignment template
    ------------------
    To create a new assignment:
    1) Write all the HTML as you normally would underneath the #assignment-description div.
    2) Anything that you want to appear in the navbar on the left needs to be enclosed
        in a <div id="unique-id" class="sidenav-anchor">. On page load, hci.js will look up
        anything enclosed in .sidenav-anchor, find the first header (h1-h6) inside it, and add
        it to the navigation pane on the left. Make sure it has a unique div id so that there is something
        to anchor the hyperlink to.
    3) I recommend going with Bootstrap's recommendation and putting any <table class="table"> elements enclosed in a
        <div class="table-responsive">.

                    <p>Before the implementation of your prototype, you compiled a list of inspirations. Since then, your prototype has probably made so many twists and turns and transformations that it is no longer recognizable as the idea that you started off with. To prepare for your final presentation, update your knowledge of related projects. Related projects can be existing applications, artifacts, products, or services that relate to your concept. Here, web search is your friend (potentially useful sites include Google, Google Scholar, the ACM Digital Library, TechCrunch, Engadget...). Pick the five related projects that a juror is mostly like to ask you "How are you different than _____?" In some cases, this might be a similar service like another to-do list, photo-sharing app, or party-finder. In other cases, it might be repurposing general services like Google Docs or Twitter.</p>
                    <p>Pick out your five favorite related projects. For each one, give a brief explanation (1-2 sentences) of how you would answer the following questions from a juror "How are you different from _____? Why would people use your application instead of _____? In what situations would people use _____ instead of your application?"</p>

This means advertising on Google or Facebook, creating a Fan Page on Facebook, posting in the Mozilla Marketplace, or announcing on your app on social networks like Facebook and Twitter. These are all just suggestions for what you might do. The goal of this extra credit opportunity is to expose your app to the public by any method you wish to use.</p>
                    <p>Submit any materials that show that you have successfully launched your application. This can include email receipts, screenshots of the app on a app store, or URLs to app listings. Also submit any materials necessary to show that people outside of this class and the university have started using your application as a direct result of your launch. Since this will differ between groups, we will leave up to you to decide what exactly is necessary to be submitted. The only requirement is to provide sufficient proof to show that you have launched your app to the public and that people have started using it.</p>

Exercise your creativity as much as possible! Try to plan out your video before actually taking any footage. Storyboards are great tool to use here. This video will not be used as part of your final presentation slides, but should instead complement your poster session as well as serve as a way for you to remember your hard work in years to come.
