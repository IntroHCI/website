    IntroHCI assignment template
    ------------------
    To create a new assignment:
    1) Write all the HTML as you normally would underneath the #assignment-description div.
    2) Anything that you want to appear in the navbar on the left needs to be enclosed
        in a <div id="unique-id" class="sidenav-anchor">. On page load, hci.js will look up
        anything enclosed in .sidenav-anchor, find the first header (h1-h6) inside it, and add
        it to the navigation pane on the left. Make sure it has a unique div id so that there is something
        to anchor the hyperlink to.
    3) I recommend going with Bootstrap's recommendation and putting any <table class="table"> elements enclosed in a
        <div class="table-responsive">.

                    <h2>Prototypes</h2>
                    <p>Idea 1: Make a conveyer belt with chairs that people can sit on to rest while in line<br />How to prototype: Bring rolling office chairs and have people sit on them to roll through line. Manually bring the front chair to the back at the end of the line for now.<br />Why: This idea addresses the fact that most people in line look/feel incredibly uncomfortable and attempts to turn the otherwise physically and mentally stressful aspects of waiting in line into a time for relaxation and reflection.</p>

                    <p>Idea 2: An app that brings up calls/texts you have to return with reminder topics so you can be productive and reconnect with people while in line<br />How to prototype: A series of index cards demonstrating various application screens/features<br />Why: This idea connects with people's want to be productive while in line and makes it easier to get work done by effectively scheduling previous "dead" time in line as people-oriented work, networking, and relaxation time.</p>

                    <h2>Insights</h2>
                    <p>Idea 1 User Insights:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The majority of people reported that they loved how comfortable it was to roll through the line instead of standing up. Many thought it changed the experience from stressful to relaxing</li>
                        <li>Some suggested that I add a bin or bag to each chair that people can place their items in while they wait so that people can have their hands free when they sit</li>
                        <li>The prototype was especially popular with disabled/pregnant people because of ease of use and physical accommodations. One pregnant lady user told me with tears in her eyes that I "made her day"</li>
                        <li>One potential problem is that if the flooring of the store is carpet or if they hold items that drag on the floor, it can interfere with the wheels and make the experience of waiting in line even worse.</li>
                        <li>Many of the younger users tried to turn the rolling office chairs into entertainment, playing games like "bumper chairs" while in line.</li>
                        <li>Most of the elderly users that tried the office chair conveyer belt used the time for relaxation, preferring only to move when necessary to go forward. These users found the most value in the chairs and expressed the most sincere appreciation.</li>
                        <li>Some people in line chose not to participate because they preferred standing in line, especially if they had just been sitting all day in class. In a real conveyer belt, there would also be the option to stand.</li>
                        <li>Everyone who I exit surveyed said they loved the simplicity of the idea. Without any explanation, everyone that came to the line knew how to use the office chair conveyer belt</li>
                        <li>Some appreciated that being at a lower vantage point caused them to notice items that were placed on lower shelfs in the store and made them more likely to pick up those items while moving through line. Could lead to a novel system of product placement in stores that use this system.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Idea 2 User Insights:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The convenience of the app was the main advantage. Users enjoyed the idea of "detecting when you are waiting in line" based off movement.</li>
                        <li>People enjoyed that most of the app was customizable, such as being able to change the people who you need to call and the reminder topics instead of it just being based on missed calls.</li>
                        <li>Some complained that the interfacing for adding customizations was clunky. They suggested a simpler system with a contact list. Some were confused about the reminder topics and didn't realize that they had the power to change them on the fly</li>
                        <li>Both users loved that it made them more productive in line. One even remembered to call her parents after using the app and said that it helped her reconnect.</li>
                        <li>Both thought that having suggested topics in advance, even if one of the suggestions is just to be grateful, was a useful feature because it can often be hard to come up with reasons to call.</li>
