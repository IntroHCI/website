    IntroHCI assignment template
    ------------------
    To create a new assignment:
    1) Write all the HTML as you normally would underneath the #assignment-description div.
    2) Anything that you want to appear in the navbar on the left needs to be enclosed
        in a <div id="unique-id" class="sidenav-anchor">. On page load, hci.js will look up
        anything enclosed in .sidenav-anchor, find the first header (h1-h6) inside it, and add
        it to the navigation pane on the left. Make sure it has a unique div id so that there is something
        to anchor the hyperlink to.
    3) I recommend going with Bootstrap's recommendation and putting any <table class="table"> elements enclosed in a
        <div class="table-responsive">.

                    <p>This week, you will start working on what will become your Web site. Remember, this class focuses on interaction, not implementation. We encourage you to make the coolest application you can, but don't require textual programming. If you're most comfortable with graphical tools, we recommend <a href="https://class.coursera.org/hci-004/wiki/view?page=DownloadingTools">Justinmind</a>. (You're of course welcome to use text tools if you prefer; the choice is yours.)</p>
                    <p> Now is the time to think about what design tool you'll use. Consider what interactions are most important to your application and what prototyping tools support those interactions. Think about that now so you don't get surprised when designing later. &nbsp;Please note that you will not start using this tool until the next assignment (right now, you are just prototyping in Balsamiq or an equivalent low-fidelity tool); this is just about thinking for the future.</p>

                    <h4>Choose a Storyboard</h4>
                    <p>Decision time. Set out your storyboards. Take a deep breath. Spend some time to reflect on the different ideas you've had. Make sure you discuss the strengths and weaknesses of each design, and how well they achieve the goals set out by your point of view. And then, decide on one of these ideas to prototype.</p>
                </div>

                <div id="prototypes" class="sidenav-anchor">
                    <h4>Create 2 Rapid, Interactive Prototypes</h4>
                    <p>Make two rapid interactive &nbsp;prototypes that implement the idea you've decided on. (Can you see we really value enumerating alternatives?) A rapid interactive &nbsp;prototype concretely shows all the elements of a user interface, except that it's implemented with very high level tools (just like pen and paper), as opposed to actual code. This is often called a ‘Wire Frame’, or ‘Wireframing.’</p><p>Rapid interactive prototypes can be done with <a href="http://www.balsamiq.com/products/mockups" target="_blank">Balsamiq Mockups</a>. (See the <a href="https://class.coursera.org/hci-004/wiki/view?page=DownloadingTools">How to: Download Tools</a> page for instruction about the installation.) If you're used to other prototyping tools, feel free to use it as long as it's a low-fidelity prototyping tool! (You may want to install Balsamiq anyway to see what kind of prototype you want to make for this assignment.) No Photoshop, no Illustrator, no polished work, even if you are familiar with them!</p><p>Again, it helps focus on the concepts, and saves you from wasting hours twiddling pixels. If you haven't understood that yet, the goal is to be fast. Years after taking this course at Stanford, students often come back and tell us that rapid prototyping (whether on paper or electronic version) was their favorite part of the class because of its effectiveness for rapid ideation.</p><p> The prototypes you create should be <b>interactive</b>. That means that your user should be able to navigate around it and get a feel for how the ‘real thing’ would work. This is not as complex as it sounds! Balsamiq's built-in tools allow you to create "links" between screens and buttons to simulate real functionality - back, next, home, etc - even though visually it is nothing more than a line drawing. </p><p>The prototypes should vary in interface, but offer the same basic functionality. For example, if you were designing a mobile transit application, your two prototypes could display the bus times in two very different ways. The prototypes should be complete enough to "run" a new user through each task. (Note: the story here is very linear, but your process doesn't have to be. You can start making a rapid prototype, then change your mind. And your prototype doesn't have to exactly align with your storyboard.) Your prototype interface should enable people to navigate, recover from errors, and change their mind.</p><p><i>(Although we are not going to do any paper prototyping in this assignment, being familiar with this concept is interesting. For further information, see the book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/1558608702">Paper Prototyping</a> by Carolyn Snyder and a few <a href="http://paperprototyping.com/references.html" target="_blank">references</a>).</i></p>

                    <p>by Mike Davison, Community TA and UX Project Manager</p><p>Wireframing is an important step in the design process. You may know how you want your application to look and wish to skip ahead, - otherwise, you need to do the work twice, right? But this step is vital. It allows you to decide on navigation, layout, menu options, application structure and much more, making quick changes as you go.</p><p>Importantly, it allows you to TEST your plan with users before you spend many hours on visual design. I recall a recent project that sprung some major surprises here; the user base disagreed fundamentally with the ‘needs’ their corporate management had identified for them. It prompted a drastic redesign...if the visual layer had been applied, we would have wasted tens of thousands more.</p><p>Think about it as if you were building a car. You do not start painting body panels and trimming the interior before you decide where the engine is going to go!</p></i>

                    <p>The heuristic evaluations will be a way to highlight usability issues in your rapid interactive prototypes. Heuristic evaluations will follow the <a href="http://www.useit.com/papers/heuristic/heuristic_evaluation.html" target="blank">"How to Conduct a Heuristic Evaluation"</a> and <a href="http://www.useit.com/papers/heuristic/heuristic_list.html" target="blank">"Ten Usability Heuristics"</a> readings by Jakob Nielsen. Using Nielsen's ten heuristics, you as an evaluator will list as many usability issues as possible. It is less important that the evaluators worry about exactly which heuristic the usability issues occur in. The heuristics are there to help evaluators find a variety of different types of usability issues. For each usability issue found the evaluator should capture a description of the issue written as concisely and as specifically as possible.</p>

                <div id="experteval" class="sidenav-anchor">
                    <h4>Being an Expert Evaluator</h4>
                    <p>As an evaluator, be thorough and write down all problems you can find. Don't try to be "nice" by not reporting problems, everything you find will help your peer improve his interface. Since you are evaluating two prototypes, try to make your feedback comparative. For example, if a prototype had a big problem that you also found in the other prototype, make a note of it. If one prototype had a problem that, for some interesting reason or another, was solved or not an issue in the other prototype, make a note of that as well. You don't have to compare both prototypes in every sentence in your evaluation (and it's even fine if most of your feedback isn't comparative), but you should highlight enough similarities and differences between the two prototypes so that the peer receiving your feedback will understand the advantages and drawbacks and each design.</p>
                    <p>Your feedback should help your peer understand and decide which features of which designs they should implement in the coming weeks. Use Nielsen's heuristics as a guide and specify what heuristic(s) each problem is related to (but if you come across problems that don't fall neatly into particular heuristics, note them down also!). In addition, write the problem down with a severity rating as in Nielsen's <a href="http://www.useit.com/papers/heuristic/severityrating.html" target="_blank">Severity Ratings for Usability Problems</a>.</p>
                    <p><b>Go over both of your peer's prototypes.</b> When grading your peers, write a heuristic evaluation of the two prototypes. This comprises a bulleted list of usability issues you found, along with their severity, for each prototype. Include comparative feedback between the two prototypes.</p>
