    IntroHCI assignment template
    ------------------
    To create a new assignment:
    1) Write all the HTML as you normally would underneath the #assignment-description div.
    2) Anything that you want to appear in the navbar on the left needs to be enclosed
        in a <div id="unique-id" class="sidenav-anchor">. On page load, hci.js will look up
        anything enclosed in .sidenav-anchor, find the first header (h1-h6) inside it, and add
        it to the navigation pane on the left. Make sure it has a unique div id so that there is something
        to anchor the hyperlink to.
    3) I recommend going with Bootstrap's recommendation and putting any <table class="table"> elements enclosed in a
        <div class="table-responsive">.

                    <h2>Assignment</h2>
                    <p>Your team will:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>give a 30 second elevator pitch of your app to the audience and jurors (with one slide displayed behind you)</li>
                        <li>give a 1 minute demo of your app</li>
                        <li>discuss and demonstrate your app in the subsequent poster session</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>First, decide what features of your prototype, process, and research you want to communicate. What should be most salient? This is not a marketing spiel - it is an academic exercise. Communicating three months of iteration, research, and design decisions in a very short time means making tough decisions. The more you boil your work down to its essence, the better. Take the core concepts and communicate them rather than explaining every detail.</p>
                    <p>Then consider the two visual deliverables you are creating, the slide and your poster, and how their content should differ. The slide is a high-level look to entice people to come and learn about your project, and should complement the 30-second presentation that you will be making while the slide is projected. Your poster is a medium-level look at your iterative, user-centered design process.</p>
                    <p>Prepare for your slide and pitch by thinking about how you want to introduce your prototype for the first time. You have thirty seconds, and most of the audience has never seen your application before. How can you provide a high-level understanding of what your application does, or what needs it addresses? Find the "hook" that will interest people and persuade them to find your poster later on. We recommend scripting your presentation and practicing it many times until it is smooth. We will have a timer running, and any presentation that goes over 30 seconds will be cut off.</p>
                    <p>Prepare for the poster session by thinking about how you are going to explain your prototype to people. Are you going to let them hold the iPod/iPhone and try it themselves? Are you going to hold it and show them? Why did you make that decision? What are you going to say to them? What part of your design do you want to emphasize? Keep in mind that attendees don't have all the background and insight into your application. Present them with the user need first, show your solution, and explain why your work is unique. Your poster should stand on its own without explanation. There will be many people there and you will not be able to engage every single person who will look at your poster.</p>
                    <p>Finally, prepare a 1-minute demo of your prototype. Keep it short, while showing off all the features of your application. When jurors and visitors come to your poster, your quick demo should inspire them to pick up the phone and continue to play around with your app. It is important to have a demo rehearsed. There will be many people there and it is important to come across as prepared and knowledgeable to your visitors.</p>

                        <li>Slide: 1 JPG file, 1024x768. No audio. 30 seconds only. After 30 seconds, it will automatically advance to the next group's slide.</li>
                        <li> An electronic version of your poster or photos of it online. There will be easels to put the posters on. Your poster will be 24" wide and 30" high. We encourage you to make the poster stiff so it stands up. People will view your poster from both far away and up close.If you show photos, make sure everything is visible and legible. It is your responsibility to get your poster printed.</li>
