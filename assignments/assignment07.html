    IntroHCI assignment template
    ------------------
    To create a new assignment:
    1) Write all the HTML as you normally would underneath the #assignment-description div.
    2) Anything that you want to appear in the navbar on the left needs to be enclosed
        in a <div id="unique-id" class="sidenav-anchor">. On page load, hci.js will look up
        anything enclosed in .sidenav-anchor, find the first header (h1-h6) inside it, and add
        it to the navigation pane on the left. Make sure it has a unique div id so that there is something
        to anchor the hyperlink to.
    3) I recommend going with Bootstrap's recommendation and putting any <table class="table"> elements enclosed in a
        <div class="table-responsive">.

                    <h2>Assignment</h2>
                    <p>By the end of this week your interactive prototypes should be fully functional. Use the JSON and handlebars techniques that you learned in lab (or equivalent technology) to populate the data for your application. Remember, we are not at the "making it pretty" phase yet, so don't procrastinate by playing with Photoshop. If you planned it out right and you have been doing your work, you should be in good shape. If not, it's time to step it up. You will get much less out of user testing if you are still struggling with bugs and a half finished interface.</p>
                    <p>Keep updating your development plan. You'll submit it again this week. (If you'd like to give yourself the option of "late days", set an early deadline so your schedule has some flexibility.)</p>

                        <li>The URL of the prototype version that you want us to see. Note: the URL must work at least until your assignment is graded. If it doesn't work, you'll receive no credit.</li>

                        <li>The PDF of your updated development plan. (<i>We recommend making a Google spreadsheet and saving it as a pdf; this gives you a snapshot for comparison.</i>)</li>

                    <p>Note: since we may grade your assignment up to a few days after submission, per the honor code, we expect that the prototype URL show the state of your prototype at the time of submission. You will very likely be updating your prototype after submission, but please do so on another version.</p>
