    IntroHCI assignment template
    ------------------
    To create a new assignment:
    1) Write all the HTML as you normally would underneath the #assignment-description div.
    2) Anything that you want to appear in the navbar on the left needs to be enclosed
        in a <div id="unique-id" class="sidenav-anchor">. On page load, hci.js will look up
        anything enclosed in .sidenav-anchor, find the first header (h1-h6) inside it, and add
        it to the navigation pane on the left. Make sure it has a unique div id so that there is something
        to anchor the hyperlink to.
    3) I recommend going with Bootstrap's recommendation and putting any <table class="table"> elements enclosed in a
        <div class="table-responsive">.

                    <p>Collect your results from your web-based data gathering. Present your results and discuss your findings. Perform any necessary number-crunching and statistical analysis of your data. Also, assess the strength of your data (for example, using a chi-squared test if applicable). Can you draw solid conclusions or are additional tests needed? What changes would you make based on these results?</p>
                    <p>For all you designers out there, get ready. &nbsp;It's time to start making it pretty. Concentrate on completing up the list of changes based on the results of your user test. Attention to detail will serve you well. Make sure the app is optimized for the mobile interface. Same drill as the other weeks, keep <strong>updating your development plan.</strong></p>

                        <li>The data that you collected. Organize this information so that we can get a sense of the raw data that you gathered. How many users did you find? What feedback (quantitative or qualitative) did you receive? We recommend organizing this information into a table or spreadsheet.</li>
                        <li>Summary of your findings. You should present any statistical analysis that you performed, and any insights or discoveries that your test helped inform.</li>
                        <li>List of the changes you would make (as a result of the online tests). We understand that your test may have concluded only recently, and you would have had time to only make small changes. But we would like you to think about additional features or improvements that are motivated by your results. Add these to your development plan if you have time to complete them.</li>
                        <li>The URL of the prototype version that you want us to see. Do not forget to give us login information. &nbsp;Note: the URL must work at least until your assignment is graded. If it doesn't work, you'll receive no credit.</li>
                        <li>A bullet list of what you have completed this week and who did what.</li>
                        <li>Your updated development plan. &nbsp;Also include a copy of last week's plan (Assignment 7) to help us during grading.</li>

                    <p>**Note: since we may grade your assignment up to a few days after submission, per the honor code, we expect that the prototype and google docs show the state of your prototype and plan at the time of submission.  You will very likely be updating your plan and prototype after submission, but please do so on another version.</p>

                    <h4>Find Related Projects: 3 Points</h4>
                    <p>Before the implementation of your prototype, you compiled a list of inspirations. Since then, your prototype has probably made so many twists and turns and transformations that it is no longer recognizable as the idea that you started off with. To prepare for your final presentation, update your knowledge of related projects. Related projects can be existing applications, artifacts, products, or services that relate to your concept. Here, web search is your friend (potentially useful sites include Google, Google Scholar, the ACM Digital Library, TechCrunch, Engadget...). Pick the five related projects that a juror is mostly like to ask you "how are you different than blank". In some cases, this might be a similar service like another to-do list, photo-sharing app, or party-finder. In other cases, it might be repurposing general services like Google Docs or Twitter. </p>
                    <p>Pick out your five favorite related projects. For each one, give a brief explanation (1-2 sentences) of how you would answer the following questions from a juror "How are you different from blank? Why would users use your application instead of blank?".</p>

                    <h4>Run Another Online User Test: 3 Points</h4>
                    <p>You launched an A/B test last week to get some valuable user feedback. However, as we discussed there are many ways to evaluate interfaces. For this extra credit, run another test. This does not have to be an A/B test, feel free to choose whatever type of test will best benefit your project. Likewise, you don't have to use Optimizely, but we will not be supporting questions about any other platform. Explore outside of the realm of A/B testing - some of the more popular options from last year are click tests, navigation tests, and page optimization tests (ex. <a href="http://www.fivesecondtest.com">FiveSecondTest</a> or <a href="http://www.navflow.com">NavFlow</a>). Just like Assignment 7 and the first part of this assignment, provide the link to the launched test -- with a brief proposal of question you are answering through this test. Also submit a summary of results from your test, include any assessment of the strength of your data or any conclusions.</p>

                <div id="launch" class="sidenav-anchor">
                    <h4>Launch Your App: 4 Points</h4>
                    <p>You have done an amazing job prototyping and evaluating your application, now it's time to see what the world thinks. Launch your app to the public. For web apps, this means advertising on google, creating a Fan Page on Facebook, posting in the Mozilla Marketplace, or announcing on your app on social networks like Facebook and Twitter. These are all just suggestions for what you might do. The goal of this section to expose your app to the public by any method you wish to use. For native apps, submit your app to the relevant app store. Submit any materials that show that you have successfully launched your application. This can include email receipts, screenshots of the app on a app store, or urls to app listings. Also submit any materials necessary to show that people outside of Stanford and CS147 have started using your application as a direct result of your launch. Since this will differ between groups, we will leave up to you to decide what exactly is necessary to be submitted. The only requirement is to provide sufficient proof to show that you have launched your app to the public and that people have started using it.</p>
