    IntroHCI assignment template
    ------------------
    To create a new assignment:
    1) Write all the HTML as you normally would underneath the #assignment-description div.
    2) Anything that you want to appear in the navbar on the left needs to be enclosed
        in a <div id="unique-id" class="sidenav-anchor">. On page load, hci.js will look up
        anything enclosed in .sidenav-anchor, find the first header (h1-h6) inside it, and add
        it to the navigation pane on the left. Make sure it has a unique div id so that there is something
        to anchor the hyperlink to.
    3) I recommend going with Bootstrap's recommendation and putting any <table class="table"> elements enclosed in a
        <div class="table-responsive">.

                    <h4>Launch Online Test</h4>
                    <p>We are going to be using <a href="http://analytics.google.com" target="_blank">Google Analytics</a> to run the A/B test you planned last week.</p>
                    <p><strong>Google Analytics does not recruit users for you.</strong> You will have to recruit your own users.</p>
                    <p>Since you will be doing a statistical analysis of the data you receive, you'll want <strong>at least 20 users</strong> for any online test you run. Thus, you'll want to have your test run for <strong>at least five days</strong>. Other than that, how you schedule your online testing analysis around your implementation plan is up to you. Do what's best for your app and your group.</p>
                </div>

                <div id="results" class="sidenav-anchor">
                    <h4>Online Test Results</h4>
                    <p>Collect your results from your A/B test. Present your results and discuss your findings. Perform any necessary number-crunching and statistical analysis of your data. Also, assess the strength of your data (for example, using a chi-squared test if applicable). Can you draw solid conclusions or are additional tests needed? What changes would you make based on these results?</p>

                    <h4>Fit and Finish</h4>
                    <p>For all you designers out there, get ready. It's time to start making it pretty. Concentrate on completing the changes based on the results of your in-person test. Attention to detail will serve you well. Make sure the app is optimized for the mobile interface. Same drill as the other weeks, keep <strong>updating your development plan.</strong></p>

                        <li>The data that you collected. Organize this information so that we can get a sense of the raw data that you gathered. How many users did you find? What feedback (quantitative or qualitative) did you receive? We recommend organizing this information into a table or spreadsheet.</li>
                        <li>Summary of your findings. You should present any statistical analysis that you performed, and any insights or discoveries that your test helped inform.</li>
                        <li>List of the changes you would make (as a result of the online tests). We understand that your test may have concluded only recently, and you would have had time to only make small changes. But we would like you to think about additional features or improvements that are motivated by your results. Add these to your development plan if you have time to complete them.</li>
                        <li>The URL of the prototype version that you want us to see. Do not forget to give us login information. Note: the URL must work at least until your assignment is graded. If it doesn't work, you'll receive no credit.</li>
                        <li>The PDF of your development plan that you submitted last week.</li>
                        <li>The PDF of your updated development plan. (<i>We recommend making a Google spreadsheet and saving it as a pdf; this gives you a snapshot for comparison.</i>)</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Note: since we may grade your assignment up to a few days after submission, per the honor code, we expect that the prototype URL show the state of your prototype at the time of submission. You will very likely be updating your prototype after submission, but please do so on another version.</p>
