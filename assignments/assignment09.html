    IntroHCI assignment template
    ------------------
    To create a new assignment:
    1) Write all the HTML as you normally would underneath the #assignment-description div.
    2) Anything that you want to appear in the navbar on the left needs to be enclosed
        in a <div id="unique-id" class="sidenav-anchor">. On page load, hci.js will look up
        anything enclosed in .sidenav-anchor, find the first header (h1-h6) inside it, and add
        it to the navigation pane on the left. Make sure it has a unique div id so that there is something
        to anchor the hyperlink to.
    3) I recommend going with Bootstrap's recommendation and putting any <table class="table"> elements enclosed in a
        <div class="table-responsive">.

                    <h2>Assignment</h2>
                    <p>Collect your results from your web-based data gathering. Present your results and discuss your findings. Perform any necessary number-crunching and statistical analysis of your data. Also, assess the strength of your data (for example, using a chi-squared test if applicable). Can you draw solid conclusions or are additional tests needed? What changes would you make based on these results?</p>
                    <p>For all you designers out there, get ready. &nbsp;It's time to start making it pretty. Concentrate on completing up the list of changes based on the results of your user test. Attention to detail will serve you well. Make sure the app is optimized for the mobile interface. Same drill as the other weeks, keep <strong>updating your development plan.</strong></p>
                </div>

                <div id="plan" class="sidenav-anchor">
                    <h4>Plan Online User Tests</h4>
                    <p>We want you to explore the web as another tool for gathering user feedback  about your application. Refer to the lecture notes regarding controlled  web experiments (e.g. A/B testing, control groups, etc.). Think  about&nbsp;what you are asking, and how to prepare a study to answer it. We are going to be running A/B tests on your application, comparing your redesign to your original application. <strong>Try to think of A/B tests that will give you information that this week's user testing didn't (or couldn't).</strong> You will be <strong>required</strong> to turn in evidence of launching your test for this assignment.</p>
                    <p>We are going to be using <a href="http://optimizely.com">Optimizely</a> for running your A/B testing. Please sign up for a 30 day trial (you will need a credit card, but no money will be charged for 30 days). With your team, figure out exactly what you want to test and how you are set up that test in Optimizely. Write up both your idea for your test and your rationale behind it. Check the <a href="http://spark-public.s3.amazonaws.com/hci/lab_videos/Optimizely.mp4">video</a> for a tutorial on how to use Optimizely.</p>
                    <p>Groups that are doing native apps should use <a href="https://testflightapp.com/">TestFlight</a> to test your apps. You are required to figure out how to run your tests in an analogous manner to Optimizely. There are open sourced libraries that allow you to do A/B testing easily.</p>
                    <p>You will be presenting the results of your online test in the next assignment. Since this is two weeks away, you will have plenty of time to run tests, analyze the results, and update your app appropriately. Your test results will be a key and critical part of your final presentation.</p>
                    <p>Write up both your idea for your test and your rationale behind it. Potential avenues of exploration include changes in color, content and interface placement, and/or interaction method. However, make sure that before you launch your test you know exactly what you want to have answered (but not the answer), and that the results in whatever form will be useful towards your design. Recall the earlier lectures about how to properly formulate questions that aren't leading your audience to choose one interface or another. Just changing color won't necessarily help shape your final product in a meaningful way, but subtle things like "Sign up now" as opposed to "Tap here to sign up" can be surprisingly insightful.</p>
                    <p><strong>Optimizely does not recruit users for you.</strong> You will have to recruit your own users.</p><p>
                    </p><p>Since you will be doing a  statistical analysis of the data you receive, you'll want <strong>at least 20 users</strong> for any online test you run. Thus, you'll want to have your test run for <strong>at least one week after the launch by this Thursday</strong>. Other than that, how you schedule your online testing analysis around your implementation plan is up to you. Do what's best for your app and your group. Just remember that you'll be presenting your online testing results on the same day as your final app. We highly encourage running more than one test, but we don't require it.</p>
                    <p>If you have any questions about online testing, please post them to the forum.</p>

                        <li>The data that you collected. Organize this information so that we can get a sense of the raw data that you gathered. How many users did you find? What feedback (quantitative or qualitative) did you receive? We recommend organizing this information into a table or spreadsheet.</li>
                        <li>Summary of your findings. You should present any statistical analysis that you performed, and any insights or discoveries that your test helped inform.</li>
                        <li>List of the changes you would make (as a result of the online tests). We understand that your test may have concluded only recently, and you would have had time to only make small changes. But we would like you to think about additional features or improvements that are motivated by your results. Add these to your development plan if you have time to complete them.</li>
                        <li>The URL of the prototype version that you want us to see. Do not forget to give us login information. &nbsp;Note: the URL must work at least until your assignment is graded. If it doesn't work, you'll receive no credit.</li>
                        <li>A bullet list of what you have completed this week and who did what.</li>
                        <li>Your updated development plan. &nbsp;Also include a copy of last week's plan (Assignment 8) to help us during grading.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>**Note: since we may grade your assignment up to a few days after submission, per the honor code, we expect that the prototype and google docs show the state of your prototype and plan at the time of submission.  You will very likely be updating your plan and prototype after submission, but please do so on another version.</p>
