    IntroHCI assignment template
    ------------------
    To create a new assignment:
    1) Write all the HTML as you normally would underneath the #assignment-description div.
    2) Anything that you want to appear in the navbar on the left needs to be enclosed
        in a <div id="unique-id" class="sidenav-anchor">. On page load, hci.js will look up
        anything enclosed in .sidenav-anchor, find the first header (h1-h6) inside it, and add
        it to the navigation pane on the left. Make sure it has a unique div id so that there is something
        to anchor the hyperlink to.
    3) I recommend going with Bootstrap's recommendation and putting any <table class="table"> elements enclosed in a
        <div class="table-responsive">.

                    <h4>Revisit the Heuristic Evaluation</h4>
                    <p>Start by taking a look at the feedback you got last week from the Heuristic Evaluations of your prototypes. Distill the HE results into a list of concrete changes you want to make to your prototype. Use what worked, and improve what didn't. If you haven't already, make a decision about the prototype you are going with. This could be one of the two you tested or a combination of them. Again, take the time you need : this is what you will be working on for the rest of the course, so make sure you will feel invested in it.</p>
                </div>

                <div id="developplan" class="sidenav-anchor">
                    <h4>Make a Development Plan</h4>
                    <p>Create a detailed and comprehensive development plan for how your interactive prototype will be built. The development plan will guide your work for the next few weeks - but be sure to fill out as much as you can for the remaining weeks in the quarter. Write down all the different components of your prototype. You can view a component as one chunk of the interaction that has a deadline for when it should be done. Pay attention when you define the chunks, it should be something concrete enough for your peers to assess if it has been completed. "Set up results page" is too vague. "Display train times on results page" is. Use a Google spreadsheet or something similar for your development plan. You are free to structure the plan as you like, but if you'd like some hints <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AjrnWBpw0TGqdEtTNFZjV2hPTEc1WWdHMUFvSVZoZnc#gid=0" target="_blank">this template</a> is for you. Thoughtfully structure deadlines--don't have everything due Thursday night every week!</p>
                    <p>From your development plan it should be clear exactly what needs to be done, and when it will be done. Be sure to plan so that the prototype is done in time for user testing. When you are done, you should have a solid feeling for your interface and be ready to move into programming.</p>
                    <p>Your plan should also list one or two outside constraints. These could include deadlines or exam dates for other classes, work, travels, or anything that will be most important for you to account for over the next few weeks.</p>

                    <h4>Create a Home Screen &amp; Key Links</h4>
                    <p>Create a home screen and add links that lead to the major screens. It's okay if the screens are placeholders; the goal is to get a navigational skeleton up there that someone can click around and get a good feel of the application's flow. Make sure that if you have a button or icon, it links to something, whether itâ€™s an implemented page or simply a holding page. You will fill in the blanks and flesh out the details later. This is a minimal requirement for the building part of the assignment. You are encouraged to go beyond.</p>

                    <p>We know that many of you have midterms or major projects this week, so this week's assignment is lighter than the next two weeks' assignments.
