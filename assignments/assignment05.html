    IntroHCI assignment template
    ------------------
    To create a new assignment:
    1) Write all the HTML as you normally would underneath the #assignment-description div.
    2) Anything that you want to appear in the navbar on the left needs to be enclosed
        in a <div id="unique-id" class="sidenav-anchor">. On page load, hci.js will look up
        anything enclosed in .sidenav-anchor, find the first header (h1-h6) inside it, and add
        it to the navigation pane on the left. Make sure it has a unique div id so that there is something
        to anchor the hyperlink to.
    3) I recommend going with Bootstrap's recommendation and putting any <table class="table"> elements enclosed in a
        <div class="table-responsive">.

                    <p>Remember, this class focuses on interaction, not implementation. You should focus on what interactions would satisfy the user needs and goals, without worrying about actually programming a workable application. We encourage you to make the coolest application you can, but don't require textual programming. If you're most comfortable with graphical tools, we recommend <a href="http://www.justinmind.com/">Justinmind Prototyper</a> since it provides nice built-in features and hosting.</p>
                    <p>Your website needs to have hyperlinks, etc., and should include example pages of what a full site would be. But you don't need to, for example, write any database code. If you had a search results page, you can include an example of that page, created with static information. You're welcome to use PHP/Python/... if you like, but that's not required.</p>
                    <p>Another easy way to host your static HTML pages is to put your files in your Public <a href="http://www.dropbox.com/">Dropbox</a> folder. If you need dynamically created pages with PHP/Python/..., <a href="http://www.heroku.com/">Heroku</a> has some free hosting services. But keep in mind that you have only two weeks to build your app, so don't be too ambitious.</p>

                    <h4>Choose a Prototype</h4>
                    <p>If you haven't already, make a decision about the prototype you are going with. This could be one of the two you tested or a combination of them. Again, take the time you need: this is what you will be working on for the rest of the course, so make sure you will feel invested in it.</p>

                    <h4>Make a Development Plan</h4>
                    <p>Create a detailed and comprehensive development plan for how your interactive prototype will be built. The development plan will guide your work for the next few weeks. Write down all the different components of your prototype. You can view a component as one chunk of the interaction that has a deadline for when it should be done. Pay attention when you define the chunks, it should be something concrete enough for your peers to assess if it has been completed. "Set up results page" is too vague. "Display train times on results page" is better. Use a Google spreadsheet or something similar for your implementation plan. You are free to structure the plan as you like, but if you'd like some hints here is a very detailed &nbsp;<a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0Ame-4omKIpLddDlvTGFqN0JqNEVXbGRGSndLc2NuTUE&amp;usp=sharing">example from a former student</a> that can be used as a template. Thoughtfully structure deadlines--don't have everything due Sunday every week!</p>
                    <p>From your development plan it should be clear exactly what needs to be done, and when it will be done. Be sure to plan so that the prototype is done in time for user testing. When you are done, you should have a solid feeling for your interface and be ready to move into programming.</p>
                    <p>Your plan should also list one or two outside constraints. These could include deadlines or exam dates for other classes, work, travels, or anything that will be most important for you to account for over the next few weeks.</p>
                    <p>The implementation plan is, for now, for development-related tasks (in a later assignment, we'll ask you to add user-evaluation tasks as well). So please plan out until the due date for Assignment 5 (November 17th), which includes tasks for <a href="https://spark-public.s3.amazonaws.com/hci/assignment_ressources/Assignment%20Previews/A5%20Preview.pdf">Assignment 5.</a></p>

                    <h4>Create a Home Screen and Links to Major Screens</h4>
                    <p>Using your selected prototyping tool, create a home screen and add links that lead to the major screens. It's okay if the screens are placeholders; the goal is to get a navigational skeleton up there that someone can click around and get a good feel of the application's flow. Make sure that if you have a button or icon, it links to something, whether it’s an implemented page or simply a holding page. This will prevent you being marked down for "broken links" in error!</p><p>You will fill in the blanks and flesh out the details later. This is a minimal requirement for the building part of the assignment. You are encouraged to go beyond. Remember: this prototype is intended to be far more polished and complete than your previous wireframe work. We have our design, it’s time to implement it, so make this look as professional and slick as you can; you want your users to get the feel of a real application. JustinMind is an industry standard tools for this job.</p>

                    <i><h2>What’s this for? A UX agency perspective</h2>
                    <p>The prototype is a very powerful tool, but it can also be a nightmare to implement and demonstrate to a client. Often they will approach it like they would a finished product, and expect every link, every tool and every function to work. If it did....we may as well just build the final product, and it can be hard to find the balance.</p><p>Always remember; a prototype is a mock up, it’s to test a solution. Prototypes can be incredibly comprehensive, or very basic - it depends on what you want to test. However, make sure it is clear - using comment bubbles, instructions or tool tips - what functionality you are trying to test.</p><p>DON’T tell a user how your application is supposed to work, of course....a good prototype will be intuitive. We have experienced "spot-the-click" with some users, who will simply move their mouse around until the pointer turns to the tell tell finger appears... bingo, a working link! Users will often work their way along a navigation bar in a prototype, clicking each button from one end to the other.</p><p>Make sure that your application isn’t going to throw an error because you forgot to implement a holding page - make it feel real, even if it’s not! If you have an online store where only one product works for testing purposes, make sure that is clear to your user.</p></i>
